# Deliverable 1 Report for WAX Labs Proposal

## Course 1: Building a Play-to-Earn Game on the WAX Blockchain

### Overview

This document outlines the completion of the first milestone for our proposal to WAX Labs. The milestone involved the creation of a comprehensive course aimed at teaching developers how to build a Play-to-Earn game on the WAX blockchain. This course includes detailed instructions on developing two essential smart contracts: one for token management and another for game mechanics.

### Smart Contracts Development

- **Token Smart Contract**: The course begins with the creation of a smart contract dedicated to managing tokens within the game. We introduce three distinct tokens that play a pivotal role in the game's economy and mechanics.
  
- **Game Smart Contract**: The second part focuses on developing a smart contract for the game itself. This includes the integration of 7 NFTs, following the atomicassets standard, which are essential for the gameplay.

### Course Curriculum

The course curriculum is meticulously designed to cover all necessary aspects of building a Play-to-Earn game on the WAX blockchain. A complete description of the course curriculum is available in the [Course Curriculum.md](Course%20Curriculum.md) file.

### Additional Details

- **Course Structure**: Given the current limitations imposed by WAX on course duration, the entire program is divided into 5 individual courses. This structure ensures that each course remains within the 2-hour duration limit, allowing for a more detailed and comprehensive exploration of the subject matter.
  
- **Extended Course Duration**: The final course exceeded the initially intended duration. This extension was necessary to ensure that all topics were covered thoroughly, providing learners with a deep understanding of building Play-to-Earn games on the WAX blockchain.

### Resources

- **Udemy Courses**: The complete course series is available on Udemy. Detailed information, including URLs, can be found in the included [ReadMe.md](ReadMe.md) file.
  
- **GitHub Repository**: A repository containing all course materials, code samples, and additional resources is accessible for students. The [ReadMe.md](ReadMe.md) file includes the repository link.
  
- **Social Media Awareness**: To increase awareness and participation, the course has been promoted across various social media platforms. Links and details are provided in the [ReadMe.md](ReadMe.md) file.

### Conclusion

This report outlines the successful completion of the first deliverable under our proposal to WAX Labs. We have developed a detailed and comprehensive course aimed at enabling developers to create engaging and functional Play-to-Earn games on the WAX blockchain.
